spanning tree:- Tree dont habving a cycle is called spanning tree
	no of edge in spanning tree is one less than no of vertex;
	no of vertex=n;
	no of edge =n-1;
	//total no of spannuing tree possible with n vertex is (n spanning tree).
	in general
		no of spanning tree==================================
				   |E|
				      C		- (no of cycle) 
				       |V|-1
			=============================================
	where C represents Combination
	|E| is no of edge.
	|V| is no of vertex.

Problems:
	* To find minimum cost spanning tree of a weighted graph.
	2 greedy methods are available for that:-
		1). Prims algorithm.
			*First select the minimum cost edge.
			*Than select the minimum cost edge connected to the already choosen edge.
		2). Kruskals Algorithm.
			*Always select minimum cost edge but if it is forming a cycle than don't 				 include it in the solution.
			*Best way to use kruskals method is (mean heap).
